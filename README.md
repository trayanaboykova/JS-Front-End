<b> Course Curriculum: JS Front-End </b>

**[JS Syntax Fundamentals](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L01_JS-Syntax-Fundamentals)**: <br>
In this section, I learned the foundational concepts of JavaScript syntax. I delved into data types and variables, understanding how to store and manipulate data. I explored conditional statements to control the flow of my programs and practiced using loops (both while and for loops) to perform repetitive tasks. Additionally, I honed my debugging skills to identify and fix errors in my code.

**[JS Arrays & Strings](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L02_JS-Arrays-And-Strings)**: <br>
I gained a comprehensive understanding of arrays and their methods, enabling me to efficiently manage collections of data. I explored string processing techniques and utilized regular expressions for advanced text manipulation. This knowledge enhanced my ability to handle and transform data in various formats.

**[Functions and Statements](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L03_Functions-and-Statements)**: <br>
In this part of the course, I learned how to declare and invoke functions, including nested functions. I explored the concept of first-class functions and practiced using arrow functions. I also focused on naming conventions and best practices to write clean and maintainable code. This section solidified my understanding of functions as essential building blocks in JavaScript.

**[Objects and Classes](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L04_Objects-and-Classes)**: <br>
I delved into the world of objects, learning about their definition, properties, and methods. I explored associative arrays and their applications. I gained proficiency in working with JSON for data exchange and manipulation. Additionally, I studied ES6 classes, understanding how to define and use them to create modular and reusable code structures.

**[DOM Introduction](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L05_DOM-Introduction)**: <br>
I was introduced to the Browser API and the Document Object Model (DOM). I learned how to target HTML elements and interact with them using the DOM API. This section provided me with the skills to dynamically manipulate web pages and enhance user interactions.

**[DOM Manipulation and Events](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L06_DOM-Manipulation-and-Events)**: <br>
In this segment, I practiced creating and manipulating HTML elements through JavaScript. I learned how to handle various types of events and explored event object properties and methods. This knowledge enabled me to create interactive and responsive web applications.

**[HTTP and REST](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L06_HTTP-and-REST)**: <br>
I gained an overview of HTTP and its importance in web development. I learned to use developer tools to inspect and debug network requests. I delved into REST and RESTful services, exploring how to interact with APIs, including the GitHub API. I also learned to use Node Package Manager (NPM) and performed CRUD operations with a NodeJS REST API, enhancing my ability to build and interact with web services.

**[Asynchronous Programming](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/JS-Front-End/tree/main/JS%20Front-End/L07_Asynchronous-Programming)**: <br>
I explored the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming. I learned about promises and how to use them for managing asynchronous operations. I practiced making AJAX requests and using the Fetch API for network operations. Additionally, I gained proficiency in using ES6 async/await syntax to write clean and readable asynchronous code.

*In this [JS Front-End Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4362/js-front-end-february-2024), I've covered the basics of JS syntax, arrays, strings, functions, objects, and classes. I explored DOM manipulation, event handling, HTTP, REST, and asynchronous programming. This comprehensive training has equipped me to design, develop, and optimize dynamic web applications for real-world scenarios.*
